# Problem Statement: Efficient Log Retrieval from a Large File

## Solutions Considered

### 1. **Reading the Entire Log File into Memory**
   - **Approach**: The idea was to read the entire file into memory and filter logs based on the input date.
   - **Challenges**:
     - The log file is 1 TB in size, which would consume a huge amount of memory and could potentially cause memory overload or crashes.
     - Not feasible for this problem as it would take too long to load and process the entire file.
   - **Conclusion**: This approach was ruled out due to its inefficiency in terms of both memory and processing time.

### 2. **Using a Database for Storing Logs**
   - **Approach**: Convert the logs into a database format (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) and query logs by date.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Setting up a database system for 1 TB of log data would require substantial overhead and additional storage space.
     - Querying from a database might not be significantly faster than simply processing the file line-by-line.
   - **Conclusion**: This was not considered optimal as it adds complexity without substantial performance gains in this specific use case.

### 3. **Reading the File Line by Line (Final Solution)**
   - **Approach**: The log file is processed line by line. For each line, the timestamp is extracted and compared with the input date. Only logs matching the date are written to the output file.
   - **Challenges**:
     - The main challenge was ensuring the solution is both time and memory efficient while handling large file sizes (up to 1 TB).
     - The solution needed to filter logs based on a specific date without reading unnecessary data into memory.
   - **Conclusion**: This solution is the most efficient for handling large files because it reads the file incrementally (line-by-line), reducing memory overhead and allowing quick filtering of logs.

## Final Solution Summary

The chosen solution reads the log file line by line and checks if the timestamp of each log entry matches the target date. If the log entry matches the date, it is written directly to the output file. This approach ensures that:
- **Memory usage remains minimal**, as only one line is kept in memory at a time.
- **Performance is optimized**, as the file is processed sequentially without the need to load the entire file into memory.
- **Scalability**: This approach scales well for very large files, making it suitable for a 1 TB log file.

### Why This Solution Was Chosen:
- **Efficiency**: By processing the log file line-by-line and writing directly to the output file, the solution minimizes memory usage and handles the large file size efficiently.
- **Simplicity**: The solution is simple to implement without the need for complex systems (like databases) or additional libraries.
- **Flexibility**: The solution is easily adaptable to different log formats or date ranges if required.

## Conclusion

The line-by-line approach for log retrieval was chosen because it is both time and memory efficient, making it ideal for handling large files such as the 1 TB log file described in the problem. This solution avoids the complexities of database setups or memory-intensive methods like reading the entire file into memory. It ensures that the task can be accomplished quickly and with minimal system resource usage. By using a sequential approach, the solution remains scalable and can handle even larger files or different date ranges without significant performance degradation.
